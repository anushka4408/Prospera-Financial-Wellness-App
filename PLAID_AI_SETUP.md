    token: linkToken,
    onSuccess: async (public_token, metadata) => {
      try {
        // Exchange public token
        const result = await plaidAPI.exchangePublicToken({ publicToken: public_token });
        
        // Sync and import transactions
        const syncResult = await plaidAPI.syncTransactions();
        await plaidAPI.importTransactions({ transactions: syncResult.transactions });
        
        // Refresh transactions list
        // ... your refresh logic
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Plaid integration error:', error);
      }
    },
